        "about" : "MASIE-NH stands for the Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent â Northern Hemisphere. It is similar to the Sea Ice Index (SII) product in that it is easy to use and gives a graphical view of ice extent in various formats. However, it relies more on visible imagery than on passive microwave data, so the ice edge position will generally be more accurate than that of the Sea Ice Index. The input is the daily 4-km sea ice component of the National Ice Center (NIC) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) product which is available separately at the NIC IMS Products Web page and IMS Daily Northern Hemisphere Snow and Ice Analysis at 4 km and 24 km Resolution data set at NSDIC. MASIE sea ice products are developed from NIC data with support from the U.S. Navy and from NOAA. MASIE is hosted by NOAA@NSIDC.",
