Large Marine Ecosystems do not cover the whole oceans, basically just the coastal areas of oceans and the river estuaries and basins which flow into them. The system of LMEs was created by US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the idea was to identify parts of ocean for natural protection purposes. Each LME on the map includes information about the extent of the LME and there is a link in the Arctic LMEs. This takes you to an info sheet about that particular LME, which have been created by PAME. These infosheets contain information about the region, which animals are found there, etc.",

It is similar to the Sea Ice Index (SII) product in that it is easy to use and gives a graphical view of ice extent in various formats. However, it relies more on visible imagery than on passive microwave data, so the ice edge position will generally be more accurate than that of the Sea Ice Index. The input is the daily 4-km sea ice component of the National Ice Center (NIC) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) product which is available separately at the NIC IMS Products Web page and IMS Daily Northern Hemisphere Snow and Ice Analysis at 4 km and 24 km Resolution data set at NSDIC. MASIE sea ice products are developed from NIC data with support from the U.S. Navy and from NOAA. MASIE is hosted by NOAA@NSIDC.",
